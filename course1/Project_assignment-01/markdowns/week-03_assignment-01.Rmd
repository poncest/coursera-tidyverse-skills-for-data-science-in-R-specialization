## Course: Introduction to the Tidyverse

This is an R Markdown for week 3 - assignment 01.

Assignment Topic:

The goal of this assignment is to create a new data science project in preparation for analyzing data. The data analysis (not actually done here) would take the dataset for health care expenditures and consider the question: Is there a relationship between healthcare coverage and healthcare spending in the United States? 

> If needed, run the following code: `install.packages('ProjectTemplate')`

## Load Library
```{r setup}
library('ProjectTemplate')
```

## Create new project template

To create new project, uncomment the code lines below
```{r new project template}

# create.project(project.name = "week-04_assignment-01",
              # template = "minimal")
```
