# Case Study #1: Health Expenditures ----

# The data for this case study are available in CSVs hosted on GitHub. CSVs from URLs can be read directly using read_csv() from readr (a core tidyverse package).

# data link: https://github.com/opencasestudies/ocs-healthexpenditure/tree/master/data/KFF

# As a reminder, weâ€™re ultimately interested in answering the following questions with these data:
  
# - Is there a relationship between healthcare coverage and healthcare spending in the United States?
  
# - How does the spending distribution change across geographic regions in the United States?
  
# - Does the relationship between healthcare coverage and healthcare spending in the United States change from 2013 to 2014?
